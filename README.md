<img src="./heathcliff/hamcar-color.svg" width="200">

scalable vector graphic (.svg) files of various comic strip/book characters. made mostly by me [(lumpenfreude)](https://twitter.com/lumpenfreude), with some line art and scaling work by 1/4 of [pangent technologies](https://twitter.com/pangenttech). updated regularly with more garbage.
